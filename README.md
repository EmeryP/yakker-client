### Links and Resources
* [Sandbox repo](https://codesandbox.io/s/ryzq74k9z4)
* [GiHub back-end repo](https://github.com/EmeryP/yakker-server)
* [GitHub front-end repo](https://github.com/EmeryP/yakker-client)


### Local Setup
* Fork and clone this repo to your local machine
* Run an `npm install` from the root directory
* Run `npm start` to fire up the client in the brower. Before this will work you'll need to start the server on your local machine by following the directions found in the README here: [GitHub back-end repo](https://github.com/EmeryP/yakker-server).
* At this point you can start chatting with any other client connected to your server.
